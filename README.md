DistributedR
============

Distributed R is a scalable high-performance platform for the R language. It enables and accelerates large scale machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph processing.

The Distributed R platform exposes data structures, such as distributed arrays, to store data across a cluster. Arrays act as a single abstraction to efficiently express both machine learning algorithms, which primarily use matrix operations, and graph algorithms, which manipulate the graphâ€™s adjacency matrix. In addition to distributed arrays, the platform also provides distributed data frames, lists and loops.

Using Distributed R constructs, data can be loaded in parallel from any data source. Distributed R also provides a parallel data loader from the Vertica database. Please see vRODBC repository.

Distributed R is delivered in a single, easy-to-install rpm file. The rpm installs the platform and all parallel algorithm R packages. Please register in https://my.vertica.com/distributedr and then download it from https://my.vertica.com/downloads/hp-vertica-distributed-r-1-0-0/.
